#Guidelines to prepare input files

https://mega.nz/folder/CU0inQRZ#BAMkRyJ28uD9_q8Iy3IXsw

In the above link the files described below can be found:

1) a PRISMA L1 image in two files: (Prisma_L1_20200918_HS.tiff, Prisma_L1_20200918_PAN.tiff) which correspond to the HS and the PAN bands accordingly.  The xy-size of the HS image is 1000x1000 px and the spatial resolution is 30 m. The xy-size of the PAN image is 6000x6000 px and the spatial resolution is 5 m. Thus, the ratio is 1/6. The wavelengths corresponding to the bands are attached in “wavelengths.txt”. These two files can be used during the training.

2) a small cropped area from the above files to be used during inference (Prisma_L1_20200918_HScut.tif, Prisma_L1_20200918_PANcut.tif. The xy-size of the HS image is 167x167 px and the spatial resolution is 30 m. The xy-size of the corresponding PAN image is 1000x1000 px  and  the spatial resolution is 5 m.

3) The pansharpened output file (PansharpenedL1_20200918_histogram_clipping.tiff). Histogram clipping was performed during training and inference as described in the pre-processing steps in github.

Below I am writing the pre-processing steps required to prepare the input during training by using gdal commands in the command line:

#Input

1. Convert Prisma_L1_20200918_PAN.tiff to 30 m spatial resolution and size 1000x1000 (downsampling with 1/6 ratio).
gdal_translate Prisma_20200918_PAN.tiff -ot UInt16 -of Gtiff -outsize 1000 1000 -r nearest Prisma_20200918_PANLR.tiff

2. Convert Prisma_20200918_HS.tiff to 180 m spatial resolution and size 167x167 (downsampling with 1/6 ratio).
gdal_translate Prisma_20200918_HS.tiff -ot UInt16 -of Gtiff -outsize 167 167 -r nearest Prisma_20200918_HSLR.tiff

3. Convert Prisma_20200918_HSLR.tiff to 180 m spatial resolution and size 1000x1000 (upsampling  with 1/6 ratio).
gdal_translate Prisma_20200918_HSLR.tiff -ot UInt16 -of Gtiff -outsize 1000 1000 -r bilinear Prisma_20200918_HSLRUp.tiff

4. Merge Prisma_20200918_HSLRUp.tiff and Prisma_20200918_PANLR.tiff to create the input file during training.
gdal_merge.py -o input_training.tiff -of Gtiff -ot UInt16 -separate Prisma_20200918_HSLRUp.tiff Prisma_20200918_PANLR.tiff

#Output

The output file during training is Prisma_L1_20200918_HS.tiff
